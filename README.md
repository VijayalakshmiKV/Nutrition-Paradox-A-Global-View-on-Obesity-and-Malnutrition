This project explores the global coexistence of obesity and malnutrition using WHO datasets (2012â€“2022). Data was analyzed with SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebook (who.ipynb) and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard (who.pbix). The study compares country, gender, region, and age-wise disparities, highlighting nations where obesity is rising while malnutrition declines. Findings show clear regional contrasts (e.g., Africa with high malnutrition vs. America with high obesity) and gender differences, with obesity often higher in females. The project demonstrates the nutrition paradox and provides dashboards for policymakers and researchers. Together, the notebook and dashboard deliver both data-driven insights and visual storytelling for better health policy decisions.
